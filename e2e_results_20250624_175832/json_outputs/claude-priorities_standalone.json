📊 Priority Recommendations:
  🎯 observability_infrastructure: Priority 95 - Critical: Need comprehensive monitoring for coordination performance with Promex + Grafana
  🎯 distributed_tracing: Priority 90 - Essential: Trace correlation across agent coordination boundaries with OpenTelemetry
  🎯 performance_monitoring: Priority 85 - Important: Real-time visibility into system performance with live dashboards

🔧 Optimization Opportunities:
  ⚡ promex_integration: Add custom Promex metrics for agent coordination performance tracking (Impact: 0.85)
  ⚡ grafana_dashboards: Engineering Elixir Applications: Real-time coordination monitoring dashboards (Impact: 0.80)
  ⚡ trace_correlation: OpenTelemetry correlation between coordination events and system performance (Impact: 0.75)

🎯 Analysis Confidence: 70.00%",
