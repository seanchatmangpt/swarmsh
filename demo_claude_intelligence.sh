# Step 2: Demonstrate Claude Intelligence Commands
echo "🧠 DEMONSTRATING CLAUDE INTELLIGENCE COMMANDS"
echo "=============================================="
echo ""

echo "1. 🎯 Work Priority Analysis:"
echo "   Command: ./coordination_helper.sh claude-analyze-priorities"
echo "   Purpose: AI analyzes work items and provides intelligent prioritization"
echo ""

echo "2. 👥 Team Formation Analysis:"
echo "   Command: ./coordination_helper.sh claude-suggest-teams"
echo "   Purpose: AI suggests optimal team formation based on workload and capabilities"
echo ""

echo "3. 🔍 System Health Analysis:"
echo "   Command: ./coordination_helper.sh claude-analyze-health"
echo "   Purpose: AI provides comprehensive system health and coordination analysis"
echo ""

echo "4. 🎯 Intelligent Work Recommendation:"
echo "   Command: ./coordination_helper.sh claude-recommend-work coordination"
echo "   Purpose: AI recommends optimal work claiming strategy for specific agent"
echo ""

echo "5. 🤖 Enhanced Work Claiming:"
echo "   Command: ./coordination_helper.sh claim-intelligent work_type description"
echo "   Purpose: AI-enhanced work claiming with intelligent decision support"
echo ""

echo "6. 📊 Intelligence Dashboard:"
echo "   Command: ./coordination_helper.sh claude-dashboard"

# Step 3: Show integration patterns
echo "🔗 INTEGRATION PATTERNS"
echo "======================="
echo ""

echo "Unix-style Claude Integration Patterns:"
echo ""
echo "Pattern 1: Pipe data to Claude for analysis"
echo "  cat work_claims.json | claude -p 'analyze priorities' --output-format json"
echo ""
echo "Pattern 2: Combine system data for comprehensive analysis"
echo "  Combined JSON → Claude analysis → Structured recommendations"
echo ""
echo "Pattern 3: Real-time decision support"
echo "  System state → Claude recommendation → Intelligent action"
echo ""

# Step 4: Show enhanced S@S workflow
echo "🚀 ENHANCED S@S WORKFLOW WITH CLAUDE"
echo "===================================="
echo ""

echo "Enhanced Autonomous Workflow:"
echo "1. 🧠 Claude analyzes system state and work priorities"
echo "2. 👥 Claude suggests optimal team formation" 
echo "3. 🔍 Claude provides system health assessment"
echo "4. 🎯 Claude recommends highest-value work to agents"
echo "5. 🤖 Agents claim work using Claude-enhanced decision making"
