## 🎁 Customer Success Stories

### Before: Integration Pain Points
```
❌ INTEGRATION CHALLENGES (BEFORE)
"It takes our team 4-8 hours to integrate with SwarmSH because we have to 
write custom parsers for each command's different output format. We've had 
multiple production issues from parsing emoji and text outputs incorrectly."
- DevOps Team Lead
```

### After: Seamless Integration
```
✅ INTEGRATION SUCCESS (AFTER)
"With the JSON API, we integrated SwarmSH into our CI/CD pipeline in 30 
minutes. The structured responses work perfectly with our monitoring tools. 
This is exactly what we needed for enterprise automation."
- Platform Engineering Manager
```
