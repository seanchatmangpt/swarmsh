## When to Use Iteration 2 Scripts

### Prerequisites
1. **Initial 80/20 optimizations completed** - Core scripts have been run
2. **System baseline established** - Performance metrics are available
3. **Advanced bottlenecks identified** - Team distribution or agent load issues
4. **Complex coordination requirements** - Multiple teams and specialized agents

### Ideal Scenarios
- **Large-scale deployments** with 10+ agents and multiple teams
- **Performance tuning** after initial optimization plateau
- **Load balancing** requirements for specialized workloads
- **Advanced coordination** needs with complex team structures

## Key Differences from Core 80/20 Scripts

| Aspect | Core Scripts | Iteration 2 Scripts |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Focus** | File sizes, basic cleanup | Agent loads, team distribution |
| **Complexity** | Simple optimizations | Advanced load balancing |
| **Prerequisites** | Fresh system | Post-optimization system |
| **Target** | 80% impact, 20% effort | Next 60% impact, moderate effort |
| **Analysis Depth** | Basic metrics | Cross-agent performance |
| **Optimization Type** | Cleanup, archival | Rebalancing, redistribution |

## Performance Expectations

### Typical Improvements
- **Agent Load Distribution**: 20-40% better balance
- **Team Efficiency**: 15-30% improvement in coordination
- **Cross-Agent Performance**: 10-25% better resource utilization
- **System Responsiveness**: 15-35% improvement in complex operations

### Resource Requirements
- **CPU Usage**: Moderate (2-5% during optimization)
- **Memory**: Medium (50-150MB during analysis)
- **Runtime**: 2-10 seconds for typical optimizations
- **Disk I/O**: Moderate (analysis and backup operations)

## Best Practices

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Run core scripts first** - Establish baseline optimizations
2. **Analyze system state** - Use iteration2_analyzer.sh to identify opportunities
3. **Select appropriate optimizer** - Use full or simple version based on needs
4. **Validate results** - Always run validator after optimization
5. **Implement feedback loop** - Use for continuous improvement

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Regular analysis** - Run analyzer periodically to detect new bottlenecks
- **Incremental optimization** - Apply changes gradually and validate
- **Performance tracking** - Monitor long-term trends and improvements
- **System health** - Ensure optimizations don't impact stability

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Large System Optimization
**Scenario**: 20+ agents across 5+ teams with complex workloads
```bash
# Full iteration 2 optimization cycle
./8020_iteration2_analyzer.sh
./8020_iteration2_optimizer.sh
./8020_iteration2_validator.sh
./8020_iteration2_feedback_loop.sh
```

### 2. Quick Load Balancing
**Scenario**: Simple agent redistribution needed
```bash
# Use simple optimizer for quick improvements
./8020_iteration2_optimizer_simple.sh
```

### 3. Performance Validation
**Scenario**: Verify optimization effectiveness
```bash
# Validate and measure improvements
./8020_iteration2_validator.sh
```

### 4. Continuous Improvement
**Scenario**: Ongoing optimization with feedback
```bash
# Comprehensive feedback cycle
./8020_iteration2_feedback_loop.sh
```

## File Naming and Output

### Output Files Generated
- `8020_iter2_analysis_<timestamp>.json` - Analysis results
- `8020_iter2_optimization_<timestamp>.json` - Optimization results  
- `8020_iter2_validation_<timestamp>.json` - Validation reports
- `8020_iter2_feedback_<timestamp>.json` - Feedback cycle results

### Backup Files Created
- Agent status backups before redistribution
- Work claims backups before rebalancing
- Team configuration backups

## Dependencies

### Required Files
- All core 80/20 optimization files
