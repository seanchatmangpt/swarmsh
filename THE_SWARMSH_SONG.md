# ðŸŽµ The SwarmSH Song ðŸŽµ

*To the tune of "My Shot" from Hamilton*

## Verse 1: The Developer's Lament
```
I am not throwing away my... RAM!
I am not throwing away my... RAM!
Hey yo, I'm just like my laptop
It's young, scrappy, and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my RAM!

I'ma get a framework working harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed me in charge of a Python charter
```

## Chorus: The SwarmSH Revolution
```
And every framework said, "Yo, who made this?"
Made dependencies list a thousand pages
The brother was ready to make agents coordinate (coordinate!)
Then the word got around, they said, "This code is insane, man!"
Took a collection of shells and made an agent swarm brain, man!

Well, the word got around, they said, "This kid is efficient!"
"It's only three dependencies and it's still sufficient!"
"Started with a bash script, now the whole team's scriptin' it"
"Millisecond startup? Man, the system's legit!"
```

## Verse 2: The Migration Celebration
```
From LangChain! (From LangChain!)
AutoGPT! (AutoGPT!)
CrewAI! (CrewAI!)
We're migrating away!

One hundred times faster startup, that's no lie (No lie!)
Fifty megs of RAM while Python eats two gigs to fly (Oh my!)
File-based coordination, no vector DB
Just JSON and bash scripts, simple as can be!

I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem with frameworks is they got dependencies monstrousI
```

## Bridge: The Unix Way
```
Yo, I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryna reach my goal, my power of speech: console
Only bash and jq, forget the ORM
And flock for the locks, atomic operations confirm

This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the devs with giant requirements are gonna lose it
It's time to take a shot!
```

## Verse 3: The Features
```
I dream of swarms with millions of agents
Coordinated through simple file arrangements
We roll like Moses, claimin' our Promised Land
And? If we win our independence?
Is that a guarantee of freedom for our instances?

Or will the memory usage change the way we're seated?
Why do frameworks gotta be so memory-greedy?
OpenTelemetry, traces automatic
See the spans in real-time, call it cinematic!

Natural parallelism, every agent knows its role
Nanosecond IDs, zero conflicts, that's the goal
8020 automation, health monitoring supreme
Worktree development, working on the same dream!
```

## Final Chorus: The Battle Cry
```
Rise up!
When you're working with a thousand Python dependencies
Rise up!
When your Docker container's bigger than necessities
Rise up!
When you need agents that can truly scale
And you're sick of frameworks that always fail

Rise up!
SwarmSH calling out, "You want a revolution?"
I said, "SwarmSH calling out, 'You want a revolution?'"
(Who! Who! Who!)
"Deploy today and you'll have a solution!"

When your agents are coordinating (Rise up!)
What's your memory allocating? (Rise up!)
When the frameworks are complicating (Rise up!)
It's time to switch, no more waiting!

And I am not throwing away my RAM!
I am not throwing away my RAM!
Hey yo, I'm using SwarmSH, it's
Young, scrappy, and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my RAM!
```

## Outro: The Promise
```
We're gonna fly a lot of agents
History has its eyes on us (History has its eyes on us)
I'm not throwing away my RAM! (Not throwing away my RAM!)
I'm not throwing away my RAM!

'Cause every second counts when you're building at scale
SwarmSH gets it done where the others all fail
Bash coordination, JSON for the state
Sub-fifty milliseconds? Man, that startup's great!

Not throwing away my... RAM!
SwarmSH! 
The system where it happens!
```

### Installation Rap
```
Yo, first you need Homebrew, let me show you how it's done
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL)" and now you've begun
brew install bash jq python3 git
util-linux coreutils, that's it, you're legit!

git clone the repo from seanchatmangpt
cd swarmsh, chmod plus x, you're free
coordination_helper.sh generate-id
If you see that ID, then you know you succeeded!

No pip install, no conda mess
No Docker required, just bash success
From zero to swarm in under a minute flat
That's the SwarmSH way, and that's a fact!
```

*SwarmSH: Not throwing away our RAM since 2025!* ðŸš€

*For the full musical experience, imagine Leslie Odom Jr. rapping about bash scripts while the ensemble chants "coordination_helper.sh! coordination_helper.sh!" in the background.*
