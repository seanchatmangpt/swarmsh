## 📋 Project Analysis Summary

### AI-Extracted Requirements
```
<think>Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the project document and extract structured information into specific sections. First, I need to understand the document thoroughly.Starting with the PROJECT OVERVIEW section. The project name is ShopSmart Mobile App, duration is 8-12 weeks, team size 4-6 developers, and budget between $150k and $200k. That's straightforward.Next, TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS. The frontend uses React Native, Redux, AsyncStorage, and native payment integration. Backend is Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL, Redis, and AWS S3. Infrastructure includes Docker, AWS ECS, CloudFront, and auto-scaling. I need to list these under the respective categories.CORE FEATURES are divided into three phases: MVP, Enhanced, and Advanced. Each phase has specific features. I should list them with their priorities, noting which phase they belong to. The MVP is the first phase, so priority 1, then Enhanced as priority 2, and Advanced as priority 3. Wait, the user mentioned to list main features with priorities. Maybe the phases are the priorities? Or the features within each phase? The original document groups them by phases, so I'll structure each phase with its features and indicate their priority as per the phase order.RISK ASSESSMENT includes technical, timeline, resource, and market risks. The document lists four risks, so I need to categorize them. Technical risk is payment integration, timeline is offline sync, resource is finding developers, market is competition. Each of these should be under their respective risk categories.SUCCESS CRITERIA has measurable goals like app store rating, page load times, uptime, compliance. These are all metrics, so list them as is.IMPLEMENTATION PHASES are the three phases mentioned in Core Features. Wait, the Timeline Estimates also have Discovery, Development, Testing, Deployment. But the user wants the implementation phases broken down. The original Core Features have three phases (MVP, Enhanced, Advanced) which are part of the Development period. However, the Timeline Estimates split into Discovery, Development (with phases), Testing, Deployment. The user's instruction says to break down into phases, so maybe the phases from Core Features are the main ones. But the user might want the phases as per the timeline. Wait, the user's instruction says "IMPLEMENTATION PHASES (break down into phases)" and the example shows phases from Core Features. Let me check the original document again. The Core Features have three phases: MVP (4 weeks), Enhanced (3 weeks), Advanced (3 weeks). So the implementation phases are these three. However, the Timeline Estimates have Discovery (1 week), Development (8-10 weeks), Testing (2 weeks), Deployment (1 week). But the user might want the phases from Core Features. The user's example in the response includes the three phases from Core Features. So I'll structure the implementation phases as the three phases from Core Features, each with their duration and features. But need to check if the user wants the phases from the timeline or the core features. The user's instruction says "break down into phases" and the example in the problem statement's response includes the three phases from Core Features. So I'll follow that.Now, making sure to focus on actionable info for software development planning. So each section should have clear, structured data without fluff.Let me verify each section again to ensure I didn't miss any details. For example, the budget breakdown is part of the budget, but the user's format for PROJECT OVERVIEW includes budget, so that's covered. The dependencies are listed, but the user didn't ask for that in the sections. The launch strategy is also not part of the required sections. So focus only on the specified sections.Alright, I think I have all the necessary info. Now, structure each section as per the user's format.</think>1. **PROJECT OVERVIEW**     - **Name**: ShopSmart Mobile App     - **Duration**: 8-12 weeks     - **Team Size**: 4-6 developers     - **Budget**: $150k - $200k  2. **TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**     - **Frontend**:       - React Native (cross-platform mobile)       - Redux (state management)       - AsyncStorage (offline data)       - Native payment integration     - **Backend**:       - Node.js with Express framework       - PostgreSQL (primary database)       - Redis (caching/sessions)       - AWS S3 (image storage)     - **Infrastructure**:       - Docker (containerization)       - AWS ECS (deployment)       - CloudFront CDN       - Auto-scaling capabilities  3. **CORE FEATURES**     - **Priority 1 (MVP - 4 weeks)**:       - User authentication and profiles       - Product catalog browsing       - Shopping cart functionality       - Basic checkout process       - Payment integration (Stripe)     - **Priority 2 (Enhanced - 3 weeks)**:       - Inventory management dashboard       - Order tracking and notifications       - Customer reviews and ratings       - Search and filtering capabilities     - **Priority 3 (Advanced - 3 weeks)**:       - Offline mode with data sync       - Analytics dashboard       - Multi-vendor support       - Push notifications  4. **RISK ASSESSMENT**     - **Technical Risks**:       - Complexity of payment integration (Stripe)       - Offline sync implementation challenges     - **Timeline Risks**:       - Offline sync implementation challenges     - **Resource Risks**:       - Difficulty finding experienced React Native developers     - **Market Risks**:       - Competition from established platforms  5. **SUCCESS CRITERIA**     - App store rating > 4.0 stars     - Page load times < 2 seconds     - 99.9% uptime     - PCI compliance for payments     - GDPR compliance for user data  6. **IMPLEMENTATION PHASES**     - **Phase 1 (MVP - 4 weeks)**:       - Focus on core user functionality (auth, catalog, cart, checkout, payments)       - Prioritize critical paths for user onboarding and transactions     - **Phase 2 (Enhanced - 3 weeks)**:       - Add inventory management, order tracking, and search features       - Implement backend integrations for reviews and notifications     - **Phase 3 (Advanced - 3 weeks)**:       - Develop offline sync and analytics dashboards       - Introduce multi-vendor support and push notifications       - Finalize compliance (PCI, GDPR) and performance optimization  ---  **Notes for Planning**:  - Allocate 80% of the budget to development ($120k) and reserve contingency for risks (3%: $5k).  - Prioritize Phase 1 to ensure MVP viability before scaling.  - Address technical risks early by validating payment integration and offline sync prototypes.  - Plan for 2 weeks of testing/QA to meet uptime and performance targets.
