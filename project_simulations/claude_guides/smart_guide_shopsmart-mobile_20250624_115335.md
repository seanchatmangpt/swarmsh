  - Add error handling

#### Phase 3: Testing & Deployment (20% - 3 days)
- [ ] **Quality Assurance**
  - Write comprehensive tests
  - Perform security audit
  - Conduct performance testing
  - User acceptance testing

- [ ] **Deployment**
  - Set up production environment
  - Deploy application
  - Monitor system performance
  - Document deployment process

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Technical Risks (Risk Level: 0.1)
- **MODERATE RISK**: Follow standard development practices
- Regular code reviews and testing

### Recommended Approach for Claude Code
1. **Start with MVP**: Focus on core functionality first
2. **Iterative Development**: 1-2 week sprints with demos
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
4. **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and deployment
5. **Documentation**: Maintain README and API docs throughout

## üìä Success Metrics & Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All core features implemented and tested
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (response time < 2s)
- [ ] Security audit passed with no critical issues
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage achieved
- [ ] Documentation complete and up-to-date
- [ ] Deployment automated and documented

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Technology Stack

### Based on Project Analysis:


### Additional Recommendations:
- **Testing**: Jest/Pytest for unit tests, Cypress for E2E
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- **Monitoring**: Application monitoring and logging
- **Documentation**: Inline code docs + README

## üìû Next Steps for Claude Code Implementation

1. **Review and Validate**: Discuss this guide with stakeholders
2. **Environment Setup**: Set up development environment
3. **Repository Structure**: Create initial project structure
4. **First Sprint Planning**: Plan Phase 1 implementation
5. **Regular Check-ins**: Weekly progress reviews and adjustments

## üîó SwarmSH Integration

Track implementation progress with SwarmSH coordination:
```bash
# Claim implementation work
./coordination_helper.sh claim "implementation" "shopsmart-mobile" "high"

# Monitor system health during development
./8020_cron_automation.sh health

# Track progress in telemetry
tail -f telemetry_spans.jsonl | grep "shopsmart-mobile"
```
